How to build frontend

1. INSTALL REQUIREJS OPTIMIZER
You need node.js already installed (NPM package)
Install the global requirejs handler. This lets you run r.js inside any directory
> npm install -g requirejs

2. COMPILE COFFEESCRIPT -> JAVASCRIPT
In any fashion you'd like. There is a script /bash/coffee.sh

3. REMOVE TRAILING SEMI-COLON
A bug in requirejs requires us to remove the trailing semi-colon from build.js
build.js is found at /media/js/src/build.js. Remove the last semi-colon in the file.

4. NAVIGATE TO THE PROPER DIRECTORY
Navigate to /media/js/src in your command window

5. RUN THE OPTIMIZER
> sudo r.js -o app.build.js

6. VIEW RESULTS
All files are built into /media/js/build. However, you only need main.js for the site
to work. Delete the rest or keep them.


If you run into errors during step 5, it's likely due to a missing dependency or an old
JS file whose coffeescript counter-part has long since been deleted. Delete the entire
/media/js/src then go to step 2.
